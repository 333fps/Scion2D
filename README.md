## Introduction
The goal for **Scion2D** is to make a simple 2D game engine where I can teach what I am learning through my youtube channel. 
This is for educational purposes and to constantly learn more about programming and gaming everyday. There are definitely better 
engines out there; however, I find it more fun to try to build your own, learn from others, and grow as a developer.

## Dependencies
**SDL2**
  * We are using SDL2 for the windowing and input functionality for our engine. SDL is easy to use and has many features.
  
**OpenGL**
  * We will be doing all of our graphics with OpenGL, maybe change to vulkan as my skills with graphics increase.
  
**Glad**
  * We will be using Glad as our OpenGL Loader library.
    
**ENTT**
  * For our Entity Component System, we will be using the wonderful ENTT library.
  * We will also be making use of ENTT's meta reflection functionality.
    
**Box2D**
  * For our physics, we will be creating a nice wrapper around Box2D.
    
**Lua**
  * The scripting language of choice for us will be Lua.
  * Lua is easy to use and understand, I also have more experience with setting lua up and using it.
    
**Sol**
  * We will be using the wonderful Sol3 library to bind our lua functions, user types, etc.
  * Sol is very easy to use and works great.
